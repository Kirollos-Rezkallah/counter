# Simple Counter App 🎯

A simple and interactive counter app built with **React** to practice fundamental concepts like **props**, **state**, **JSX**, and **components**. This project is part of my React learning journey. 🚀

## Features ✨

- **Increment/Decrement**: Increase or decrease the counter value by a specified step.
- **Reset**: Reset the counter to its initial value.
- **Dynamic Styling**: The counter text changes color based on its value (green for positive, red for negative).
- **Reusable Components**: The `Counter` component is highly reusable and accepts `initialValue` and `step` as props.

## Live Demo 🌐

## Technologies Used 💻

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
- **JavaScript**: For logic and interactivity.
